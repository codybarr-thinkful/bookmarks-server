# bookmarks-server

Assignment for Node Module / Checkpoint 10.

## Assignment

Build an API for the Bookmarks client supporting GET, POST and DELETE.

## Requirements

-   Use the boilerplate to start a new application named bookmarks-server
-   Configure logging and API key handling middleware on the server
-   Write a route handler for the endpoint GET /bookmarks that returns a list of bookmarks
-   Write a route handler for the endpoint GET /bookmarks/:id that returns a single bookmark with the given ID, return 404 Not Found if the ID is not valid
-   Write a route handler for POST /bookmarks that accepts a JSON object representing a bookmark and adds it to the list of bookmarks after validation.
-   Write a route handler for the endpoint DELETE /bookmarks/:id that deletes the bookmark with the given ID.

## Follow Up Checkpoints

**Checkpoint 15**

Had to refactor the bookmarks-server app to use Postgres / Knex Service (instead of JS array in memory) for
the `GET` requests (`/bookmarks` and `/bookmarks/:bookmark_id`).

**Checkpoint 16**

Had to refactor to use Postgres / Knex for `POST` and `DELETE` requests. Used TDD to write failing tests first
then implemented to the routes / services to make them pass.

**Checkpoint 17**

Had to refactor to use Postgres / Knex for `PATCH` requests (updating existing bookmarks). Also wrote tests
for this route.
